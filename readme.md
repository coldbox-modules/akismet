This SDK allows you to add Akismet capabilities to your ColdFusion (CFML) applications. You will need an Akismet API key in order to use this model. For more information visit: http://www.akismet.com

## Installation 
This SDK can be installed as standalone or as a ColdBox Module.

### Standalone

This SDK can be instantiated by using the `Akismet.cfc` with the following constructor arguments:

```
/**
* Constructor
* @blogURL.hint The front page or home URL of the instance making the request. For a blog, site, or wiki this would be the front page. Note: Must be a full URI, including http://.
* @apiKey.hint The Akismet API Key
* @applicationName The application name used in the user agent as per the Akismet API
* @HTTPTimeout The http timeout in seconds.
*/
function init( 
	string blogURL="", 
	string apiKey="", 
	string applicationName="CFAkismet",
	numeric HTTPTimeout=10 )
```

### ColdBox Module

This package also is a ColdBox module as well.  The module can be configured by creating an `akismet` configuration structure in your application configuration file: `config/Coldbox.cfc` with the following settings:

```
akismet = {
	// The blog URL to connect
	blogURL = "",
	// The Akismet API Key
	apiKey = "",
	// Application name
	applicationName = "",
	// HTTP Timeout
	HTTPTimeout = 10
}
```

Then you can leverage the SDK CFC via the injection DSL: `akismet@akismet`
